Write a program to implement the Activity Selection Problem using the
Greedy Method. Given n activities with their start and finish times,
select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities that can be
performed by a single person, assuming a person can only work on one
activity at a time.

ALGORITHM : Activity Selection (Greedy Method)

• First, we sort the given activity array in ascending
order based on the completion time of each activity.
• After sorting, we select the first activity.
• Then, for rest of the activities, we compare the
starting time of the current activity (j) with the
completion time of the previous activity (i).
• If the starting time of the current activity is greater
than or equal to the completion time of the previous
activity, we select this activity as it is a non-overlapping
activity.
• Then, we update the value of i with j and increase
the count by 1.
• After completion of the loop, we return the count of
total selected activities.

CODE :

#include <stdio.h>
typedef struct {
int start; // Start time of the activity
int finish; // Finish time of the activity
} Activity;
void swap(Activity *a, Activity *b) {
Activity temp = *a;
*a = *b;
*b = temp;
}
void sortActivities(Activity arr[], int n) {
for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
if (arr[j].finish > arr[j + 1].finish) {
swap(&arr[j], &arr[j + 1]);
}
}
}
}
int activitySelection(Activity arr[], int n) {
sortActivities(arr, n);
int count = 1;
int i = 0;
printf("\nSelected Activities (Non-overlapping):\n”);
printf("Activity 1 -> Start: %d, Finish: %d\n", arr[i].start, arr[i].finish);
for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
if (arr[j].start >= arr[i].finish) {
printf("Activity %d -> Start: %d, Finish: %d\n", j + 1, arr[j].start, arr[j].finish);
i = j;
count++;
}
}
return count;

}
int main() {
int n;
printf("Enter number of activities: ");
scanf("%d", &n);
Activity activities[n];
printf("Enter start and finish times of activities:\n");
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
printf("Activity %d: ", i + 1);
scanf("%d %d", &activities[i].start, &activities[i].finish);
}
int result = activitySelection(activities, n);
printf("\nTotal number of non-overlapping activities selected: %d\n", result);
return 0;
}
